<h1>What are 3D Groups?</h1>

<p>3D Groups consist of 3 people, doing 3 tasks, meeting once a week for 30 minutes, to answer 3 questions.<br />
We are Determined to Develop a Deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.<br />
The focus: be obedient to the task of reading God’s Word daily and praying to be used by God.</p>

<h1>Things to do Daily:</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Read 1 chapter, starting with the New Testament.</li>
	<li>Highlight or make note of Scripture that sticks out to you, causes you to think, or offers new insight.</li>
	<li>Pray that God would allow you to be used to lead others to Jesus and grow God’s Kingdom.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Weekly 30 Minute Group Meeting:</h1>

<ol>
	<li>How did you do with reading every day?</li>
	<li>Share a few highlighted passages or notes from your reading.</li>
	<li>How did you connect with someone outside the church this week?</li>
</ol>
